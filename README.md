# LEGO-BaQFA
The program for a BaQFA LEGO Mindstorms robot


The program contains the options for either 10min, 20min or 30min time interval between images, and run for an endless amount of time.
When either option of the program is started, it will first take 2 test images in order to verify plate position and image quality.
